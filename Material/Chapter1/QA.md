  Because most users do not fully understand or efficiently use hardware, an OS acts as an intermediary to help users utilize the computer system effectively. The OS has three main goals:
  
  1. Ease of use
  2. Ability to run programs and assist users in solving problems
  3. Efficient utilization of hardware resources
